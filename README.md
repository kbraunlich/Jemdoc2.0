# Jemdoc
Jemdoc is a light text-based markup language designed for creating websites. It takes a text file written with jemdoc markup, an optional configuration file and an optional menu file, and makes static websites that look something like [this one](http://jemdoc.jaboc.net/).

### Motivation
This revision to [jemdoc](https://github.com/jem/jemdoc) seeks to keep this utility tool with modern standards in web development. Since 2007, new technologies and modifications have been made to HTML and CSS. Jemdoc, in its present state lacks some of the features of the [HTML5](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/) standard including basic HTML markup such as:
- Semantic HTML tags
- HTML Forms 
- Responsive web design

In addition, CSS3 has seen some changes as well. The most important feature concerning styling is the ability to use CSS Preprocessors, that have become common in the web development world.

This revision to jemdoc seeks to keep jemdoc abreast with these changes
